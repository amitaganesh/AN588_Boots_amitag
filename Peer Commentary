1. What I learned from running their Original Homework Code that helped improve my own code:
Running your code reminded me how helpful it can be to manually structure bootstrap simulations using a simple for loop. 
While I used replicate() in my own code for compactness, seeing each coefficient stored iteratively made the process more transparent, especially for debugging purposes. 
Your use of clearly named vectors for intercepts and slopes also made the output easier to parse than relying on matrix indexing.

2. What I did in my own code that might help to improve theirs:
In my version, I encapsulated the bootstrapping logic into a general-purpose function that accepts a data frame, model formula, confidence level, and number of bootstraps. 
This modular approach makes it easier to reuse the bootstrapping logic for different datasets and models — and could help simplify your script, especially if they attempt the extra credit. 
Additionally, I included a visualization of how bootstrap CI estimates stabilize as the number of bootstraps increases, which helped me better interpret the reliability of the estimates. 
Adding that kind of graph could further strengthen your discussion of the results.

3. What challenges, if any, we both faced in our code that could not be helped by comparison:
I faced similar difficulties interpreting how close the bootstrap CIs should be to those reported by lm() — and what it means when they differ. 
Conceptually, this required digging into the assumptions of both methods, especially understanding how non-normality or small sample sizes could cause discrepancies. 
Also, formatting the output to cleanly compare model-based vs. bootstrap-based estimates was trickier than I expected — aligning CI outputs from different sources took some care.

4. Whether the annotation/commenting on your peer’s Original Homework Code is readable and interpretable to you, and if not then how it could be improved:
The code is quite readable, and I appreciated the straightforward style of the annotations. 
However, I noticed a few points that could be improved: the boot_slopes vector is redefined unnecessarily toward the end, and there’s some duplicated text around the challenge description. 
Cleaning up redundant comments and organizing the code into logical sections (e.g., “Setup,” “Bootstrapping,” “Comparisons”) would improve readability. A final comment summarizing the comparison results would also help tie things together.
