Challenge 2 - Then, use bootstrapping to sample from your data 1000 times with replacement, each time fitting the same model and calculating the same coefficients. This generates a sampling distribution for each 𝛽

# 95% CIs from both the bootstrap and linear model should be pretty close if the model assumptions are good. If they’re different, the bootstrap might be a more reliable method.

# Challenges: Getting the hang of bootstrapping in R was a bit tricky.
#It took some time to fully understand how to interpret the regression results.
#The dataset had some formatting issues I had to fix before I could analyze it.
#Comparing the bootstrap SEs to the model SEs was a little confusing at first.

# I had to double-check the 95% CIs to make sure everything lined up properly.
